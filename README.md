## Purpose
To help people use their ingredients by providing recipes that match the available ingredients and have a list of of groceries for the ingredients they dont have.

## User Story
As a hungry person I want to find something to eat

As a person with some ingredients in the cupboard/fridge I want to search for what can be made with them and see a list of recipes

If I still need ingredients to complete a meal I want to easily be able to make a shopping list

As a person who goes shopping I want an interactive list i can use to help me keep track of what i need to buy
